How to use Stitching macro (Antonio Trabalza)
============================
For GRID scans acquired by Prairie system:


1)  Click on: Plugins > Stitching > Grid/Collection stitching.
2)  Select Type > Positions from file.
3)  Select Order > Defined by image metadata.
4)  Click OK, a dialog will appear.  
5)  Browse to the .xml in the grid folder.
6)  Select Fusion method > Max. Intensity, 
    choose Linear Blending only for publication/presentation figures.
7)  Leave the default values for the thresholds.
8)  Tick Add tiles as ROIs based on your requirements.
9)  Untick Compute overlap - IMPORTANT - you trust the coordinate in the file. 
10) Leave all unticked except for: Invert Y coordinates.

11) Click OK to start the stitching process.

The duration of the process varies depending on the size of the mosaic (number of tiles)
and on your hardware. Have a break!



For coordinates-wise montages of arbitrary number of ROIs:

1)  Install one of the "Nostromo" macros that are in this repository (eventually).
2)  Run it on any given session/timepoint (eg. _a, _b, etc.).
3)  Wait. If your computer is old/not powerful wait even more.
    (To have an idea of the progress you can open the "Processed_MAX_Projections" subfolder in your timepoint).
4)  In FIJI select File > New > TrakEM2 (blank).
5)  A dialog to select a storage folder will appear. Choose wisely!
6)  TrackEM2 will open.
7)  Right click on the black image field.
8)  Select Import > Import from text file...
9)  Browse to and select the CoordinatesZ(n).txt file relative to the images that you want to stitch.
    the macro saves them in the Zoom(n) subfolder of the Stitching_ready_tiffs folder.
10) A options dialog will appear.
11) Select Column separator > Comma(,).
12) Tick Homogenize contrast layer-wise (to improve the LUT).
13) Click on OK.
14) The Enhance contrast dialog will appear.
15) Leave the default 0.4% saturated pixels.
16) Untick every box (important) and click OK
18) The Choose source directory dialog will appear.
19) Choose the parent directory of the text file you are using.
    (eg. the one containing the .tif files you want to stitch)
20) Wait and then HAVE FUN!
